# Neelofar Portfolio (React + Tailwind Play CDN)

Quick start:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev`

Notes:
- Tailwind is included via the Play CDN in `index.html` so no Tailwind config is required.
- Replace `/assets/headshot.jpg` with your actual photo.
- Update project links in `src/components/Projects.jsx`.
- Configure Formspree endpoint in `Contact` form action before deploying.
